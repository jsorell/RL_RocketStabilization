# RL_RocketStabilization

Some quick comments:

1. The agentDef.py file contains the code for training the network by importing the environment class from the rocketSim.py file. If you want to continue training from a saved mode, 
see the comments that say IMPORTANT and make adjustmants to load those files accordingly.

2. The testTrainedModel.py file can be used to test the model, to use the keyboard to control the simulation, and to create the GIF animations. This code must be adjusted based
on the purpose that it is being used for by commenting out or in code.
